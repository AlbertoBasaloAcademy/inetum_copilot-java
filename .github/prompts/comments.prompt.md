# Code Comments 

Add comments to the code to explain its functionality, purpose, and any important details that would help future developers understand it.

## Context

- The #codebase tool to inspect the actual source code and configuration.

## Workflow

- Use the #codebase tool to inspect the actual source code and configuration.
- Identify key classes, public methods, and functions that would benefit from comments.
- Do not add comments to self-explanatory code or trivial getters/setters.
- Add comments to complex logic, important decisions, and any non-obvious code.
- Use appropriate comment styles for the programming language.
